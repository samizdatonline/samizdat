        <p>This site is a work in progress. It aims to bring global news outlets to
            everyone, despite national boundaries and autocratic controls. Its purpose
            is to break through the DNS blacklisting. We don't profess to
            know the truth. We do know that a free press helps uncover it.
        </p>
        <p>Please see the source code and details at

            Get involved if you can.
